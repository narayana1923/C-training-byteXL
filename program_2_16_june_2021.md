## Number operations
You will be given a number `N` and you have to apply some operations on that number. Every operation is represented as a number `K`.

### Operations: 
#####  If K is less than the N and odd then subtract K from N, if K is even then divide the N with K.
##### If K is greater than N and odd then multiply K and N, if K is even then add K to N.
##### If K is equal to N then double N.

You have been given a sample code. You have to complete the remaining code.

### Input format:
The first line contains a single integer N.
The next line contains another integer T representing the number of operations.
The next T lines contain an integer `Ki` representing the operation.

### Output format:
Print the N value after all the operations.
