## Central Point
You have been given an array arr of N elements. You have to find the central point of the array.

The central point of an array of integers is defined as the index such that the sum of all the elements at lower indices is equal to the sum of elements at higher indices.
#### Input format:
The first line contains N, denoting the array size.
The second line contains N space-separated integers.
#### Output format:
Print the central point of the array. If no central point then print -1.
#### Sample input:
7

-7 1 5 2 -4 3 0
#### Output:
3
#### Explanation:
-7+1+5 = -4+3+0

 -1 = -1, 
 
 So central point is 3.
